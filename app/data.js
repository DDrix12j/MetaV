The trait can be useful as a last effort on most Hunters, however Clerk and Dream Witch benefit from it the most due to their abilities to use the trait in quick succession.' },
    { id: 'excitement', name: 'Excitement', image: 'Excitement.png', description: 'The trait allows the Hunter to be protected and perform actions that would otherwise be prevented by stuns, such as successfully chairing a Survivor or to land a crucial hit. The trait is especially recommended in matches with multiple powerful stunners that can free survivors, such as Forward and Coordinator, and in matches with Survivors that heavily rely on their stuns, such as Enchantress and Prospector.' },
    { id: 'patroller', name: 'Patroller', image: 'Patroller.png', description: 'The trait allows the Hunter to temporarily summon a Patroller to quickly run up and restrict a Survivor. The trait can be very useful for Hunters who benefit from restricting a Survivor to use their skills, most notably as Gamekeeper and Naiad. The trait can however be countered by Survivors getting behind obstacles and vaulting windows and pallets, so it\'s important to use it in appropriate situation where the survivor is caught offguard. Patroller can also see use in stalling rescuers approaching chairs to waste their time.' },
    { id: 'teleport', name: 'Teleport', image: 'Teleport.png', description: 'The trait allows the Hunter to quickly move across the map to apply pressure and quickly cycle from one Survivor to the next. Teleport can be very beneficial for most Hunters, especially so in late-game, but it is particularly useful for Hunters that can quickly move around the map, such as Wu Chang and Geisha. Teleport however sacrifices a chasing aid, so it is best used by bringing Trump Card and switching to it once Survivors have been chaired or the Cipher Machines have been completed.' },
    { id: 'peeper', name: 'Peeper', image: 'Peeper.png', description: 'The trait allows the Hunter to observe a survivor through obstacles in the Peeper\'s radius and quickly catch up to them by slowing down their running and interaction speed. It is especially useful on Hunters with ranged abilities that can benefit from the see-through effect, such as Axe Boy and Violinist. The trait can also be useful in crucial areas, such as Cipher Machines, in order to slow down decoding and keep track of Survivors across the map.' },
    { id: 'blink', name: 'Blink', image: 'Blink.png', description: 'The trait allows the Hunter to phase through obstacles and walls in order to land crucial hits on chased Survivors, at the cost of a very long cooldown. Because of this, Hunters bringing Blink should make cautious use of it and successfully land their hits. Survivors can predict a Blink use, so it\'s important to use it when the chased Survivors are caught offguard or cannot avoid a hit. The trait is powerful on most Hunters, but characters who rely mostly on their primary damage such as Hell Ember and Photographer benefit from Blink the most.' },
    { id: 'warp', name: 'Warp', image: 'Warp.png', description: 'The trait allows the Hunters to create a set of two portals, they can use them to warp between the two locations twice before the portals disappear and the ability enters in cooldown. Survivors can see some visual effects when the Hunters are warping between the portals but they can\'t interact with them. Some Survivor\'s abilities can force the hunter through the portal like stunning them, pushing them away or switching positions with them.' }

Another thing that Mary struggles with is her core ability "Aqua Mirror" where she summons image of herself to attack survivors, that takes 15s of cooldown which force you to be extra careful when using it, the skill cooldown itself is already worth around 20%~ of the cipher decoding progress, not to mention how alot of decoders such as mechanic, prisoner, lawyer punish this factor, at best she a tie guarantee character.
